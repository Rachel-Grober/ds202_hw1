The most recent commit was the first commit, adding the whole file to git (120ca7d4e9e6d5243cef8fb6e1cd635f266eab4a)

The rmarkdown file did not open right away, we had to change the file path for the image.

Something that would make github easier is having a cheatsheet of all of the commands needed.
